# Features

The VanRakshak, or Forest Guardian, is a comprehensive model designed to ensure the absolute safety and protection of forests. Its multifaceted approach incorporates various technologies to monitor and safeguard the forest ecosystem. Here's a breakdown of its working:

- _Aerial Monitoring for Deforestation:_

  - VanRakshak employs aerial monitoring systems, such as satellite imagery or drones, to observe and analyze the forest cover.
  - Through advanced image processing algorithms i.e. an ensemble of unet++,linkednet and linkednet implemented using mobilenetV2, it detects changes in forest density and identifies areas where deforestation is occurring.

- _Deforestation Alert System:_

  - The model is equipped with an alert system that triggers notifications when a significant decrease in forest cover is detected.
  - This real-time alert system allows authorities to respond promptly to potential threats and take necessary actions to prevent further damage.

- _Audio Analysis for Illegal Activities:_

  - VanRakshak processes audio recordings from the forest environment.
  - It uses sound analysis algorithms and mel spectrogram to differentiate between natural sounds, such as animal noises, and human-made sounds, such as the operation of tools like chainsaws.
  - If suspicious sounds indicative of illegal activities are detected, the system can generate alerts to notify authorities and facilitate timely intervention.

- _Criminal Apprehension:_

  - By identifying the specific audio signatures associated with illegal activities, VanRakshak aids in locating and apprehending individuals engaged in activities like illegal logging or poaching.
  - This capability enhances the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in combating environmental crimes.

- _Forest Fire Prediction:_

  - The model includes a forest fire prediction system that utilizes CatBoost algorithm to identify areas at high risk of wildfires.
  - By analyzing various factors such as weather conditions, vegetation density, and historical fire data, VanRakshak can predict and highlight regions susceptible to forest fires before they occur.

- _Comprehensive Forest Protection:_
  - Through the integration of these technologies, VanRakshak provides a holistic approach to forest protection.
  - It not only addresses deforestation issues but also targets illegal activities that pose a threat to the ecosystem.
  - By predicting and preventing forest fires, the model contributes to the overall well-being and longevity of forests, which are essential for sustaining life on Earth.

In summary, VanRakshak serves as a powerful tool in the conservation and protection of forests by employing cutting-edge technologies to monitor, detect, and prevent threats to these vital ecosystems.
